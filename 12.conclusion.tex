\section{Conclusion}
Therefore, ethics in robotics are diverse and broad-ranging and includes safety questions, concerns on user’s privacy, questions on autonomy, questions on accountability to the public and robots ability to replace humans in workplaces. Advancements in the field of robotic technology continue at a rather fast pace, and thus there is a growing need for direct regulation when it comes to structuring the use of robots for physical assistant positions. Business codes of ethics should therefore promote the dignity of individuals and communities, confidentiality and equity while encouraging creativity. Such issues can be solved with the help of cooperation between technical, ethical and political – oriented specialists to make robotics bring a positive impact to human lives, creating no threat to the basic rights and values of people.
